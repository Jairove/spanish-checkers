An implementation of the spanish checkers game, made as a quick project for university and intended to be simple. It is programmed in Python and implements a GUI based on pyGTK. The game allows you to play versus another human, save and load the game state, and undo moves. Some special rules have been added, for example, every time the current player jumps over a rival's checker an algorithm looks for the best move and performs it, making several jumps. All the code is in one file, called Damas.py, internal documentation and messages are written in spanish. Several bugs and bad practises may be found as I programmed this in order to learn Python.
