An implementation of the spanish checkers game, special rules have been added to the game. This project was intended to be simple, it's made in Python and has a GUI implementing pyGTK. The game allows you to play versus another human, save and load the game state, and undo moves. Every time the current player jumps over a rival's checker an algorithm looks for the best move and performs it, making several jumps. All the code is in one file, called Damas.py, internal documentation and messages are written in spanish. Several bugs and bad practises may be found as I programmed this for learning python.
